# go-pinger

A simple Go app to ping websites.
This is a simple Go application to ping websites for fun ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‰.

### How it works

There is a CSV file `ping_urls.csv` from which the application will read the list of urls to ping. For each url we will create a goroutine. After that, we will wait to receive channel messages from the goroutines.
Once we receive all the messages for the urls we will bulk insert the results into MongoDB a single document for each of the response of a url.
